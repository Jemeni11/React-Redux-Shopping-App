# React-Redux-Shopping-App

### A shopping web app built with React, Redux (ToolKit), React Router and Vite.

I also used the [FakeStoreApi](https://fakestoreapi.com/).

This web app allows buyers to browse products by categories, add to cart, and checkout.

### Scripts
  - `yarn dev` or `vite`:  start dev server, aliases: `vite dev`, `vite serve`.
  - `yarn build` or `vite build`: build for production.
  - `yarn preview` or `vite preview`: locally preview production build.
