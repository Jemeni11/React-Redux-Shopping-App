# React-Redux-Shopping-App

### A shopping web app built with React, Redux (ToolKit), React Router and Vite.

I also used the [FakeStoreApi](https://fakestoreapi.com/).

[Live Site](https://jemeni-react-redux-shopping-app.netlify.app/)

This web app allows buyers to browse products by categories, add them to their cart, and checkout.

This site was deployed with Netlify. [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/0bd95ac3-1e3e-4f0d-af41-10225612b357/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/jemeni-react-redux-shopping-app/deploys)
